/** Interface for [(univariate real) root-finding][UnivariateSolver] that maintain a bracketed solution. There are several advantages
 * to having such root-finding algorithms:
 *
 *  * The bracketed solution guarantees that the root is kept within the
 * interval. As such, these algorithms generally also guarantee
 * convergence.
 *  * The bracketed solution means that we have the opportunity to only
 * return roots that are greater than or equal to the actual root, or
 * are less than or equal to the actual root. That is, we can control
 * whether under-approximations and over-approximations are
 * [allowed solutions][AllowedSolution]. Other root-finding
 * algorithms can usually only guarantee that the solution (the root that
 * was found) is around the actual root.
 *
 *
 *
 * For backwards compatibility, all root-finding algorithms must have
 * [ANY_SIDE][AllowedSolution.ANY_SIDE] as default for the allowed
 * solutions.
 * @param <FUNC> Type of function to solve.
